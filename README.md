OSSCIntro
=========

A document that will be used by members of the Open Source Software Committee of the [Casualty Actuarial Society](https://www.casact.org) to collaborate on learning collaborative editing using repositories. Currently, the pdf is not captured in the repository so that the repository does not balloon with each version. Users will have to clone the repository and knit the document locally. If there is need to keep a locally compiled version, the Github [release mechanism](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software) will need to be used.
